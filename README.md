## Objective
Cognitive impairment often occurs in the context of neurodegenerative disease and dementia. Methods that can accurately predict impaired cognition are extremely valuable to both healthcare professionals and third-party managed care systems. Using novel technology (e.g., machine learning) on cognitive test data and neuroimaging features may be helpful in accurately classifying those with and without cognitive deficits. What makes this study unique is that new neuropsychological data was used to assist in making these predictions (i.e., information typically used by neuropsychologists that is not directly encoded into the original dataset).

### Methods Used
* Exploratory data analysis
* Inferential statistics
* Logistic regression
* Supervised machine learning
* Data visualization

### Technologies
* Python
  * pandas, NumPy, SciPy, seaborn, Matplotlib, sklearn
* Jupyter Notebook
* HTML
* AWS

## Project Description
The current project was inspired by problems I encountered during my professional career, including challenges related to predicting cognitive dysfunction and neurologic disease. Other individuals completed [similar projects on kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/jboysen/mri-and-alzheimers). 

The original dataset can be found on the [Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS) website.](http://www.oasis-brains.org/) The OASIS initiative was aimed toward providing extensive neuroimaging data to the public to promote scientific insights in clinical neuroscience.
