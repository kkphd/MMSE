## Predicting Cognitive Impairment

Cognitive impairment often occurs in the context of neurodegenerative disease and dementia. 
Methods that can accurately predict impaired cognition are extremely valuable to both
health care professionals and third-party managed care systems. Using novel
technology (e.g., machine learning) on cognitive test data and neuroimaging features 
may be helpful in accurately classifying those with and without cognitive deficits.
